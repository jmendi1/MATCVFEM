# MATLAB toolbox for the control volume finite element method (CVFEM)
MATCVFEM is a free set of MATLAB functions for the numericalsolution of moving boundary problem using the control volume finite element method. 
## Download and Installation
In order to install and use the MATCVFEM, you must already have [MATFEM](https://github.com/parkmh/MATFEM) on your computer. 

1. Download the MATCVFEM to your desktop

`git clone https://github.com/parkmh/MATCVFEM.git`

2. Open MATLAB and type the following in the command window:

`>> cd (MATCVFEM folder)`
`>> install`

## Mesh Generation
*pdetool* starts the PDE app, which helps you to draw the 2-D domain and refine mesh.
1. Run *pdetool*.
`>> pdetool`
2.
